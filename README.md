# Simulated-Annealing-Metropolis-MC-
  This code can be used to simulate the order-disorder transition in multi-component alloys (high-entropy alloys). The code takes simulated annealing algorithm and Ising-model like Hamiltonian as energy input. The code can give specific heat curve, transition temperature and temperature dependent long-range (LRO) and short-range order (SRO) parameters.  The code is written in C++ code. In order to use the code the users need to firstly install ATAT package of Dr. A. van de Walle of Brown University.

  Follow this example to perform parallel Metropolis Monte-Carlo simulations.
